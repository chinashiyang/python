#Implement a function that takes a sequence (a list or a tuple) and returns
#an iterable of pairs containing a unique item and number of times the item is presented in the given
#sequence. A pair is tuple of 2 elements. Pairs in the iterable returned may be ordered arbitrary.
#Note. Name your function compress and save it into a unique.py file.
#Example
#expected_sorted = [(1 , 2 ) , (2 , 1 ) , (3 , 1)]
#actual_sorted = sorted ( compress ([1 , 2 , 1 , 3]) )
#assert expected_sorted == actual_sorted


expected_sorted = ['a', 'b', 'c']
a=(x,y)
zipped  # Holds an iterator object
<zip object at 0x7fa4831153c8>
>>> type(zipped)
<class 'zip'>
>>> list(zipped)
[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
return
expected_sorted = [(a ,b),(c,d)]
